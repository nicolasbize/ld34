2 button controls
-----------------

Idea: you're an executioner that has a drinking problem.
Each week you have to execute someone using a bow/arrow.
Controls will be done using mouse like a sniper, using the left button for power... (might have to rethink that to fit the theme better...)
You have 3 arrows to kill the person. Better kills will earn you more money/points.
Each victim will have body parts for ADDITIONAL FUN AND GORE.. because those 2 go so well together... ahaaauuum.
